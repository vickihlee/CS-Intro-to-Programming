## Homework Assignments

### Exercise 1: Area of a Room

Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once
the values have been read, your program should compute and display the area of the
room. The length and the width will be entered as floating point numbers. Include
units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending on which
unit you are more comfortable working with.


### Exercise 4: Tax and Tip

The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal
ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and
tip for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing.
Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). The output from
your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for
the meal including both the tax and the tip. Format the output so that all of the values
are displayed using two decimal places.


### Exercise 36: Vowel or Consonant

In this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.


### Exercise 37: Name that Shape

Write a program that determines the name of a shape from its number of sides. Read the number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of   a meaningful message. Your program should support shapes with anywhere from 3 up to (and including) 10 sides. If a number of sides outside of this range is entered then your program should display an appropriate error message.


### Exercise 63: Temperature Conversion Table

Write a program that displays a temperature conversion table for degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit. The table should include rows for all temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius that are multiples of 10 degrees Celsius. Include appropriate headings on your columns. The formula for converting between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit can be found on the internet.


### Exercise 70: Caesar Cipher

One of the first known examples of encryption was used by Julius Caesar. Caesar needed to provide written instructions to his generals, but he didn’t want his enemies to learn his plans if the message slipped into their hands. As result, he developed what later became known as the Caesar Cipher. The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as a result, it provides no protection against modern code breaking techniques). Each letter in the original message is shifted by 3 places. As a result, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, D becomes G, etc. The last three letters in the alphabet are wrapped around to the beginning: X becomes A, Y becomes B and Z becomes C. Non-letter characters are not modified by the cipher. Write a program that implements a Caesar cipher. Allow the user to supply the message and the shift amount, and then display the shifted message. Ensure that your program encodes both uppercase and lowercase letters. Your program should also support negative shift values so that it can be used both to encode messages and decode messages.


### Exercise 81: Compute the Hypotenuse

Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean theorem, as the function’s result. Include a main program that reads the lengths of the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user, uses your function to compute the length of the hypotenuse, and displays the result.


### Exercise 82: Taxi Fare

In a particular jurisdiction, taxi fares consist of a base fare of $4.00, plus $0.25   for every 140 meters traveled. Write a function that takes the distance traveled (in kilometers) as its only parameter and returns the total fare as its only result. Write a main program that demonstrates the function. Hint: Taxi fares change over time. Use constants to represent the base fare and the variable portion of the fare so that the program can be updated easily when the rates increase.


### Exercise 83: Shipping Calculator

An online retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate of $10.95 for the first item, and $2.95 for each subsequent item. Write a function that takes the number of items in the order as its only parameter. Return the shipping charge for the order as the function’s result. Include a main program that reads the number of items purchased from the user and displays the shipping charge.
